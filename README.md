# Valheim.DontDrop

Did you spawn a level 1000 troll? This mod simply stops the loot from dropping and crashing your game.

This mod is just intended to help you remove the problematic creature. The mod should be removed or disabled when your game no longer contains the game killing creature or ragdoll.

## Manual Installation

- Get and install BepInEx
- Download the latest zip
- Extract it in the \<GameDirectory\>\Bepinex\plugins\ folder.
